This demos:
1. Build an executable
2. Build a shared library
3. Executable/library installation
4. Assign an alias to targets.
   When run `scons alias_name` all targets with same alias will be build.

Behavior:
Because in the SConstruct file, the default target has been set to 'all',
invocations of scons without given target will apply to the default 'all' target.

'install' and 'alsoinstall' are not the default target, and one has to specify
'install' or 'alsoinstall' explicitly when some action is needed.

1. $ scons
   Build 'helloworld' executable and 'libhello.so' without installation.
2. $ scons --clean
   Remove 'helloworld' executable and 'libhello.so' and related object files.
3. $ scons install
   Will build 'helloworld' and 'libhello.so', if they have not been build.
   And install 'helloworld' to `pwd`/install/bin
               'libhello.so' to `pwd`/install/lib
4. $ scons alsoinstall
   The behavior is the same as that of `scons install`, because 'alsoinstall' is
   set to be an alias of 'install'.
5. $ scons --clean
   Will only remove 'helloworld' executable, 'libhello.so' and related objects from current dir.
6. $ scons --clean install
   Will uninstall installed binaries, and do same things as `scons --clean`
